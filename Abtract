Healthcare professionals require comprehensive understanding of brain tumor symptoms and locations for accurate diagnosis and treatment. The automatic segmentation of brain tumors using 3D MRI plays a pivotal role in diagnosis, follow-up, and therapy planning. Traditional manual delineation methods, while effective, pose significant challenges. They are expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to human errors. In response to these limitations, we present an innovative method for classifying brain tumors into three distinct categories. This approach not only streamlines the diagnostic process but also mitigates the drawbacks associated with manual techniques. By automating the classification process, we aim to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve accuracy in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning. This transformative method contributes to a more accessible and advanced healthcare system, ensuring patients receive timely and precise care. The integration of automated segmentation aligns with the evolving landscape of medical technology, fostering a paradigm shift toward more efficient and reliable healthcare practices.
