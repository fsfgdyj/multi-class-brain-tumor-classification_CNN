Deep learning-based brain tumor classification from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a
significant research problem. The research problem encounters a major challenge. The training
datasets used to develop deep learning algorithms could be imbalanced with significantly more
samples for one type of tumor than others. This imbalance in the training dataset affects the
performance of tumor classification using deep learning models as the classifier performance
gets biased towards the majority class.

The objective of this study is to develop a model for detecting and classifying objects in images.
The accurate identification of objects in images has various applications in computer vision and
object recognition tasks. This methodology outlines the steps taken to build and train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model for this purpose.
